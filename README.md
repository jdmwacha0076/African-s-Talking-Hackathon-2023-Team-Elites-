## Repository Description
### Africa's Talking Open Hackathon Dar Es Salaam, TZ: Airtime
#### Team Name: Team Elites
##### Use Case Focused: Incentives Survey Platform 
Project Description: An incentivized survey platform is a solution that allows users to earn Airtime by completing surveys. This platform can be integrated into a website or mobile app and uses Africa's Talking Airtime API to process Airtime payments and reward users for their participation.


Here's how it could work

1.Users sign up for the platform and provide their mobile phone numbers.
	
2.The platform sends surveys to users via email or SMS, asking them to provide their opinions on various topics.
	
3.Users complete the surveys and earn a certain amount of Airtime as a reward.
	
4.The platform uses Africa's Talking Airtime API to process the Airtime payments and credit the users' mobile phone accounts.
	
This platform will be used by businesses and organizations to gather valuable insights and feedback from their customers or target audience. The Airtime incentives provided by the platform can help increase usersâ€™ response rate and participation.

Additionally, the platform can be used by market research firms, political campaigns, and even university researchers to gather data and insights from the population since data plays a vital role in this digital world. 

The platform can also be monetized by charging businesses or organizations for access to the survey data and insights gathered.
